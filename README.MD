Baristo kiosks are self-contained autonomous cashless coffee kiosks, with a prepaid coffee  cup and smartphone app. Check out https://www.robobev.com for more details in the coming months.

This Git repo holds code for multiple CPUs that reside inside the Baristo Kiosk. It's broken down into the following five directories (***JAVA_Code, PLC_Code, SPIN_Code, ARDUINO_Code, and CPP_Code***). We look forward to community support to help push beverage robotics to the next level.

***
JAVA_Code: Highest level code which was designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+, NVIVIDA TX2, and/or a Microsoft Surface Book 2016. Other platforms will be supported in the future or may work now with a little  hardware reconfiguration.
