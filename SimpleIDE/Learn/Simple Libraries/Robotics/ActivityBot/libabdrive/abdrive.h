 * @brief This library takes care of encoder monitoring and servo signalling, 
 * and provides a simple set of functions for making the ActivityBot go certain
 * distances and speeds.

 * algorithm execution and servo control.

 *
 * @par Memory Models
 * Use with CMM.

 * @li drive_getTicksCalc
 * @li drive_getTicks
 * @li drive_open
 * @li drive_encoderPins
 * @li drive_servoPins

 *
 * @version 0.5.1
 * @li Trim enabled by default.
 * @li Clear trim settings during calibration. (v0.5.1)

 * @todo
 * @li Make ramp go to percentage of full speed
 * @li Correct error in start string verification

 * its direction boundary
