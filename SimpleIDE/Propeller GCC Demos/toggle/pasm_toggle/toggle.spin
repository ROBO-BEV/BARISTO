Propgcc - PASM toggle demo

Simple PASM routine to demonstrate interaction between PASM subroutines an PROPGCC main program.
The code running in the C address space to talk to exchange data values with PASM code running
in a COG.

The C program has visibility/access to the mailbox variables as normal C variables.
The PASM program has visibility/access to the mailbox variables through the PAR register
initialized by the COGNEW and hte RDLONG/RDWORD/RDCHAR and WRLONG/WRWORD/WRCHAR instructions.  

C program starts the PASM routine via cognew() function, passing strat address and PAR register value.
PAR register should be the address of a STATIC data area of LONGs in the C program.

For this example:

PAR ->  static unsigned int delay;
        static unsigned int pins;
        static unsigned int loop_cnt;
        static unsigned int pasm_done;

The first three variables are used as input to the PASM routine, the last is used to act as a semaphore
back to the C routine.

This could have been written as more efficient PASM code but for the examples, I was going for maximum clarity at this point.
