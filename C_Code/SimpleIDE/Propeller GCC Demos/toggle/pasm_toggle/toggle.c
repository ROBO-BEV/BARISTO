 * @file toggle.c
 * This program demonstrates starting a PASM COG

 * and from PASM back to C. 
 *
 * C to PASM Mailbox example
 *
 * WARNING: This code makes all IO pins except 30/31 toggle HIGH/LOW. Check if this is OK 
 * for the board you are using.
 *
 *
 * to use:
 * from directory containing source
 * make clean
 * make
 * propeller-load -pn -t -r toggle.elf  (where n is port #)
