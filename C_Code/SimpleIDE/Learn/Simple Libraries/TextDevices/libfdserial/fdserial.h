 * @brief This library supports creating and managing one or more full duplex
 * serial connections with peripheral devices.  The pointer returned when a
 * connection is opened can be used to identify the connection for other
 * calls with fdserial parameter types in this library.  The identifier can
 * also be used to identify the serial connection for higher level formatted
 * text transmit/receive functions with text_t parameter types in the
 * simpletext library.  
 * 
 * @par Core Usage 
 * Each call to fdserial_open launches an additional cog that can support
 * an additional UART communication process.
 *
 * @par Memory Models
 * Use with CMM or LMM. 
 *
 * @version 0.86
 *
 * @par Help Improve this Library
 * Please submit bug reports, suggestions, and improvements to this code to
 * editor@parallax.com.
